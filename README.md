**HEALTHCARE DATA ANALYSIS**

The analysis includes cleaning the dataset, handling missing or inconsistent values, and generating visualizations to explore important variables such as age distribution, billing amounts, length of hospital stay, and gender-based patterns.

Packages Imported:

1.pandas: Used for loading, cleaning, and manipulating the dataset (structured tabular data).

2.matplotlib.pyplot: Used for creating basic data visualizations like bar charts and histograms.

3.seaborn: Built on top of Matplotlib, used for creating more attractive and informative statistical graphics.

4.warnings: Used to suppress unnecessary warnings during the analysis process.

5.datetime (via pandas): Used implicitly to convert date columns into datetime format for calculating hospital stay duration.

Key Insights include:

1.Age Distribution: The data shows that certain age groups are more frequently admitted to hospitals, indicating which populations may require more medical attention.

2.Gender Trends: Visual analysis revealed gender-based differences in healthcare usage, potentially highlighting gender-specific health risks.

3.Billing Patterns: Billing amount variations helped identify both common treatment costs and high-cost outliers, which may correspond to severe or prolonged medical conditions.

4.Length of Stay: Analyzing hospital stay durations gave insights into treatment efficiency and patient recovery times.

5.Boxplots and count plots were used to visualize these trends and highlight possible risk factors.

6.A correlation heatmap was generated to visualize relationships between numerical features such as Age, Billing Amount, and Length of Stay.

Conclusion:This project demonstrates how data analysis can uncover actionable healthcare insights. 
By identifying high-risk groups and understanding cost and condition patterns, this analysis supports smarter clinical planning, resource allocation, and patient care strategies.
